That video tells a fun story about a future where everything is connected. And that future is not very far away! There are already refrigerators that can tell your connected device that the supply of milk is getting low. And smart homes where you can tell your home system to make coffee. We even have some driverless cars!
Connections are how we create networks. But what do we really mean by ‘networks’? If you use social media, you know your social network there. The power grid in your city or town is also a network. A grove of Aspen trees is actually a network of many trees that all share the same root system. There are networks in nature and human-created networks. The internet is a network of networks, and some of those networks are made up of many things. Those networks are what we call the IoT.

## 1.1.1 The Evolution of Digital Transformation

In our world today, there are more smart devices than there are people. A growing number of people are connected to the internet, in one way or another, 24 hours a day. An ever-increasing number of people have, and rely on, three, four, or more smart devices. These might include smartphones, exercise and health monitors, e-readers, and tablets. It is forecast that on average, there will be 3.4 smart devices or connections for every person on earth.

The IoT is relevant to many industries. IoT systems contribute to the environmental controls, retail, transportation, healthcare, and agriculture industries among many others. According to Statista, the number of IoT devices that are in use across all relevant industries is forecast to grow to more than eight billion by 2030. As for consumers, important areas of growth are internet and digital media devices, which includes smartphones. This area is also predicted to grow to more than eight billion by 2030. Other applications with more than one million connected devices are connected and autonomous vehicles, IT infrastructure, asset management, and electric utility smart grid.

How is it possible for so many devices to be connected?

Modern digital networks make all this possible. The world is quickly being covered with networks that allow digital devices to interconnect and transmit. Think of the mesh of networks like a digital skin surrounding the planet. With this digital skin, mobile devices, electronic sensors, electronic measuring devices, medical devices, and gauges are all able to connect. They monitor, communicate, evaluate, and in some cases automatically adjust to the data that is being collected and transmitted.

As society embraces these digital devices, as digital networks continue to grow around the world, and as the economic benefits of digitization continue to grow, we are seeing a digital transformation. Digital transformation is the application of digital technology to provide the stage for business and industry to innovate. This digital innovation is now being applied to every aspect of human society.

## 1.1.2 Lab - How Connected are You?

It is important to understand that most people born since the 1990s, will have grown up in a primarily digital world. This survey will help you to recognize how much of the day is actually spent “connected”. This will help us to see the impact this generation will have on business and the economy.

## 1.1.3 The Impact of Digital Transformation on Business

Smart Home Automation

Digital Technology has enabled business to innovate their approach to interacting with society. People from all generations are more comfortable with digital technology and are using smart devices to their advantage throughout their busy days.

Smart Buildings

Many companies now provide some or all of their services on-line. From the comfort of your home, car, gym, or office, you can shop for groceries on-line, order restaurant meals to be delivered to your door, book travel on-line, order clothes, camping gear, taxis, stay connected to friends, or meet a new love interest.

Sensors are everywhere generating massive amounts of data.

Smart homes can be equipped with motion sensors, water sensors, light sensors, doorbell sensors, and temperature sensors. There can be sensors in traffic lights, transport trucks, parking garages, security cameras, trains, and planes. All of these sensors and measuring devices collect and transmit their data. The data can be stored and analyzed at a later date or it can be analyzed immediately to be used to modify computers, mobile devices, or processes of any sort.

How is the stored and analyzed data used?

Businesses determine buying patterns, forecast new trends, and streamline production.
Governments monitor the environment, forecast population trends, predict crime rates, and plan for social services.
Cities control traffic, monitor parking, provide police or fire support quicker, and control waste management

## 1.1.4 Can Smart Devices Think?

All digital devices work based on computer programs and supplied data. Artificial Intelligence implies that these devices are able to think on their own. If programmed appropriately, smart devices are able to evaluate data that is provided to them and modify processes or settings “on the fly”. If they are provided with sufficient data, they can “learn” and modify their own code based on the new parameters.

Imagine a refrigerated transport truck, carrying frozen goods, that is equipped with a global positioning sensor. As the truck drives into a major city, the sensor determines that there is an accident ahead that is causing major traffic congestion. The sensor sends the data to the computer system that collects the data and make decisions. The system then alerts the driver to the new conditions so that the accident can be bypassed. This automatic interaction has saved the driver time and will get the transported product to market faster with a product that is still frozen.

Corporate offices can be occupied by thousands of employees. Keeping the environment, such as lighting, heat, humidity, in the building within acceptable parameters helps to keep employees happy and therefore more productive.

Smart Cities, such as Barcelona, Spain, use sensors to control many of their infrastructure systems such as traffic flow, parking, water utilization, and hydro.
Example 1: Weight sensors in parking spaces allow drivers to quickly know where there is an available parking spot. This reduces driving and idling time for the driver and lowers carbon emissions for the environment.
Example 2: Sensors on traffic lights can detect traffic congestion. This data is sent to the computer system that collects data and make decisions. The new decisions are sent to actuators that modify red versus green light times to assist the flow of traffic. This also alleviates idling but also reduces driver frustration and accidents.

Self-driving cars are revolutionizing transportation. The cars are equipped with many ultrasound sensors, cameras, precision GPSs, and computers. The combination of the on-board equipment allows the computers to identify, other cars, lanes, pedestrians, and obstructions. This information allows the car to stay in its lane, stop when required, and weave around obstructions.
Some of the manufacturers in the "autonomous car" market are Tesla Motors, General Motors, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz. Corporations such as Waymo, Google's sibling, and Uber are also designing and testing the technology.
The road to complete autonomy using this technology is complicated. There have been many high profile crashes and some serious accidents involving self-driving cars. Some states within the USA have already approved limited use of self-driving cars but researchers believe it will be a few years before the technology becomes mainstream.
Once the technology is proven, what is next? Self-driving trucks? Airplanes? Trains?

## 1.2.1 Networking is the Foundation

Thirty billion things provide trillions of gigabytes of data. How can they work together to enhance our decision-making and improve our lives and our businesses? Enabling these connections are the networks that we use daily. These networks provide the foundation for the internet and the digitized world.

The methods that we use to communicate continue to evolve. Whereas we were once limited by cables and plugs, breakthroughs in wireless and digital technology have significantly extended the reach of our communications.

Networks form the foundation of the digitized world. Networks come in all sizes. They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting millions of devices.

Simple networks in homes enable connectivity to the internet. They also enable the sharing of resources, such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local computers.

In businesses and large organizations, networks can provide products and services to customers through their connection to the internet. Networks can also be used on an even broader scale to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers. Networks allow for email, instant messaging, and collaboration among employees. In addition, the network enables connectivity to new places, giving machines more value in industrial environments.

The internet is the largest network in existence and effectively provides the “electronic skin” that surrounds the planet. In fact, the term internet means a “network of networks”. The internet is literally a collection of interconnected private and public networks. Businesses, small office networks, and home networks connect to the internet.

## 1.2.2 Network Types

Modern networks can be a bit confusing. There are many types that are characterized by their geographic size, by the number of devices or networks that they connect, and by whether they support mobile devices or not. Networks can also be characterized by their function and purpose.

Personal Area Network (PAN)

Personal area networks are small networks where connected wireless devices are within personal reach. Connecting your smartphone to your car using Bluetooth is an example of a PAN. Other wireless protocols that can be used in a PAN are Zigbee and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB).

Local Area Network (LAN)

LANs are typically networks in a small or local geographic area, such as a home, small business, or department within a large corporation, as shown in the figure. LANs can connect two or more devices, including computers, printers, and wireless devices. LANs provide access to larger wide area networks (WANs) and the internet.

Wide Area Networks (WANs)

The term WAN typically refers to a collection of LANs that provides inter-LAN and internet connectivity for businesses and governments.

Internet

The internet is a multi-layer global network system that connects hundreds of millions of computers. The internet is not owned by any one person or organization. This large system is comprised of multiple local and global networks serving private, public, business, academic, and government purposes. It allows for the exchange of data between more than a hundred internet-linked countries worldwide. This makes the internet an enormous carrier of various information resources and services. Some of these include text and multi-media data, email, online chat, VoIP, file transfer and file sharing, ecommerce, and online gaming.

Wireless Networks

Wireless networks are those computer networks that use electromagnetic waves instead of wires in order to carry signals over the various parts of the network. Wireless networks can be described as PANs, LANs or WANs, depending on their scope. Because browsing the internet is considered a normal daily activity, wireless access points have become commonplace in the communication infrastructure today. Public internet-connected places include libraries, airports, coffee shops, hotels, and specialized internet cafes. Thanks to Wi-Fi technology, the internet can now be accessed by every person with a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. The table shows the different categories of wireless networks that are available.

- The Cloud
    - The term “cloud” is used in many different ways. The cloud is not as much a type of network as it is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers that are used to store and analyze data, provide access to on-line applications, and provide backup services for personal and corporate use. Cloud services are provided by different organizations.

- The Edge
    - The edge refers to boundary between a organization's network and the internet. It defines the place at which a network administered by one organization connects to a network administered by a different organization. A common example is the point at which a corporate network connects to the internet. An organization may have more than one network edge depending on its size and the location of its facilities.
