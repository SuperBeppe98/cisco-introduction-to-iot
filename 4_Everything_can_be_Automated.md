## 4.0.1 Iota - Why Should I Take this Module?

- Here’s where the IoT gets really interesting. When you have the connection, some programming basics, some things like sensors and actuators, and the data to make decisions, you can automate many tasks. You can connect your smart phone to your smart oven. Put some unbaked cake in the oven and tell your oven to bake them at 4:30 in the afternoon. Voila! Your house smells delicious, and you have warm cake when you get home
- But automation is a lot more than connecting your phone to your oven. One common example of automation is an automobile assembly line. It used to be that people stood in one place in an assembly line and completed their one task over and over. Now, automobiles are mostly assembled by robots and humans monitor the line to ensure that it is working properly. And speaking of automobiles, today’s rideshare apps use machine learning from traffic IoT devices to optimize routing. That saves time and money for the rider and gets the driver out for the next ride faster. With the IoT, so many more processes can now be automated. What would you automate?

## 4.1.1 Video - What is Automation?

- This is a media player component. Select the play / pause button to watch or listen.
Automation is any process that is self-driven and reduces, then eventually eliminates, the need for human intervention
- Automation was once confined to the manufacturing industry. Highly repetitive tasks such as automobile assembly were turned over to machines and the modern assembly line was born. Machines are excellent at repeating the same task without fatigue and without the errors that humans are prone to make in such jobs. This results in greater output, because machines can work 24 hours a day without breaks. Machines also provide a more uniform product
- The IoT opens up a new world in which tasks previously requiring human intervention can become automated. As we have seen, the IoT allows the collection of vast amounts of data that can be quickly analyzed to provide information that can help guide an event or process
- As we continue to embrace the benefits of the IoT, automation becomes increasingly important. Access to huge amounts of quickly processed sensor data started people thinking about how to apply the concepts of machine learning and automation to everyday tasks. Many routine tasks are being automated to improve their accuracy and efficiency
- Automation is often tied to the field of robotics. Robots are used in dangerous conditions such as mining, firefighting, and cleaning up industrial accidents, reducing the risk to humans. They are also used in such tasks as automated assembly lines
- We now see automation everywhere, from self-serve checkouts at stores and automatic building environmental controls, to autonomous cars and planes. How many automated systems do you encounter in a single day?

## 4.1.2 How is Automation Being Used?

- Smart Home Automation
    - For many, the home environment has become a more automated environment. Devices such as the Apple Homekit, Amazon Alexa and Echo, and Google Assistant allow us to give voice commands to control such things as lights, locks, doors, thermostats, plugs, switches, alarm systems, window coverings, sprinkler system sensors, and more. Even kitchen appliances and pet care functions are being automated. Companies are producing new products every day to work with these home automation systems
- Smart Buildings
    - Enterprises of all types are using smart technology to automate building processes. Smart Buildings deploy many of the same technologies as smart homes. These processes provide efficient lighting, energy, heating, air conditioning, and security. For example, a smart building can reduce energy costs using sensors that detect how many occupants are in a room and adjust the heating or cooling appropriately
    - Smart buildings can also connect to and communicate with the smart grid. This enables more efficient management of energy systems
- Industrial IoT and Smart Factories
    - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), brings together machines, advanced analytics, and people. It is a network of manufacturing devices and sensors connected by secure, high-speed communications technologies. This results in systems that can monitor processes; collect, exchange, and analyze data; and use that information to continually adjust the manufacturing process
    - We are currently in the fourth industrial revolution, or what is called Industry 4.0. This describes an environment where machinery and equipment are able to improve processes through automation and self-optimization. Industry 4.0 extends beyond the manufacturing process and into functions like planning, supply chain logistics, and product development
    - For more information on Industry 4.0 visit here.
- Smart Cities
    - What do Hamburg, Barcelona, Kansas City, Jaipur, Copenhagen, and Manchester have in common? They are all “smart cities” that use digital technology to make their city a better place to live. Some of these cities use technology to reduce carbon emissions or monitor CO2 levels. Others use technology to provide free city-wide Wi-Fi access, improve public safety, or improve transportation options. To learn more about Smart Cities click here
- Smart Grids
    - The power grid connects the consumers and producers via a network of transmission lines, power substations, and transformers. The disruption in electricity can affect all parts of life. For example, homeowners can be left without heat during an extreme winter storm
    - The Smart Grid is a more reliable and efficient way to distribute electricity. The Smart Grid allows for two-way communication between the utility facilities and the consumers. The Smart Grid will consist of technology and equipment so the power grid can respond digitally to the change in power demands. Some of the benefits associated with the Smart Grid include:
        - Efficient transmission of electricity
        Cost reduction for utility providers and consumers
        Reduce peak demand
        Integration of large-scale renewable energy system
        Improved security
- Smart Car Technology
    - Most of today’s new motor vehicles have integrated technology that assists drivers to be safer on the road. Technology exists that prevents drivers from drifting into adjacent lanes or making unsafe lane changes. Systems automatically apply the brakes if a vehicle ahead of them stops or slows suddenly. These safety technologies use a combination of hardware and software to identify safety risks and to take action to avoid a crash. The continuing evolution of these technologies have given rise to Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that can handle the whole task of driving when we do not want to, or cannot do it ourselves. Self-driving vehicles can now operate fully autonomously, without the intervention of a driver
- Stores and Services
    - Tasks that were once done by people are now increasingly being done by machines. Fast food restaurants are setting up self-serve kiosks for order entry, banks are increasingly turning to automated teller machines or apps that are designed to run on smart phone, and supermarkets and department stores have installed self-serve checkouts
    - Systems have even been designed to monitor inventory levels and automatically place orders to accurately match supply to demand and eliminate excess inventory
- Medical Diagnosis and Surgery
    - The medical profession relies on doctors and nurses to run tests and make a diagnosis based on the results. Systems have now been developed that use technology to accurately and automatically conduct these medical tests. These systems then search through comprehensive data bases making a large number of calculations and comparisons. The result is in a more accurate diagnosis and treatment regime than might be possible from a single individual. Also, machines are now being used to more precisely control the treatment, which minimizes peripheral damage to the patient
- Aircraft Auto-Pilot
    - Planes today are built to fly themselves. A complex collection of systems automates a plane’s operations. After a flight path is entered, the autopilot system collects information about the route, location, air speed, altitude, and engine thrust. It makes adjustments to keep the plane safely on the intended path. Redundancy in system design ensures that a failure in any one system would not jeopardize passenger safety

## 4.1.3 Lab – Automate Everyday Events

- In this lab you will examine your daily life. What processes are already automated and what processes would you like to see automated in the future?

## 4.1.4 When 'Things' Start to Think

- Can things think? Can a device learn from its environment? In this context, there are many definitions of the word “think”. One possible definition is the ability to connect a series of related pieces of information together, and then use them to alter a course of action
- For example, when we are young we have no concept that a fire is hot and that placing our hand in the fire will cause pain. A fire may appear visually pleasing and actually encourage one to try and touch the flames. We quickly learn that the fire can cause injury. We then start to associate the image of the fire with the pain it can cause. From this point on we start to think about the results of touching the fire and base our actions on this acquired information
- Many devices now incorporate smart technology to alter their behavior under certain circumstances. This can be as simple as a smart appliance lowering its power consumption during periods of peak demand or as complicated as a self-driving car
- Whenever a decision or course of action is taken by a device based on an outside piece of information, then that device is referred to as a smart device. Many devices that we interact with now have the word smart in their names. This indicates that the device has the ability to alter its behavior depending on its environment
- What smart technology and devices have you interacted with today?

## 4.1.5 Check Your Understanding - Automation or Not Automation?

- 8 Quiz

## 4.1.6 Packet Tracer – Explore the Smart Home

- In this activity, you will explore the smart home example. Depending on the application, some data is best processed close to its source. The smart home example takes advantage of fog computing to monitor and act upon the levels of smoke detected in the home

## 4.2.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)?

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence demonstrated by machines. This is in contrast to natural intelligence which is the intelligence displayed by living organisms. AI uses intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and make decisions that maximize the probability of obtaining a specific goal or objective. AI refers to systems that mimic cognitive functions normally associated with human minds such as learning and problem solving
- Some of the tasks that currently are deemed to require a degree of AI are autonomous cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, strategic game playing, and military simulations
- As technology develops, many of the tasks that at one time required AI have become routine. Many of these tasks have migrated from AI to Machine Learning (ML)
- ML is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to “learn” from their environment. This enables computers to improve on a particular task without being specifically programmed for that task
- This is especially useful when designing and programming specific algorithms is difficult or infeasible. Examples of such tasks in computer science include malicious code detection, network intruder detection, optical character recognition, computer speech recognition, and computer vision
- One objective of learning is to be able to generalize based on experience. For machines, this involves the ability to perform accurately on new, previously unseen tasks after gaining experience with a learning data set. The training data set must come from data that is representative of the larger data pool. This data pool enables the machine to build a general model about this data, which would help it make accurate predictions

## 4.2.2 Machine Learning in the IoT

- List of expandable sections. Select each button to expand the content
- One of the features of the IoT is that it enables the collection of extremely large pools of data that can “teach” programs how to respond in certain conditions. Some of the more common uses of ML technology include:
    - Speech Recognition
        - Many different companies now offer digital assistants which allow you to use speech to communicate with a computer system. Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon all offer this service. These companies not only allow commands to be given verbally, but offer speech-to-text capabilities
    - Product Recommendation
        - Systems build up a customer profile and recommend products or services based on previous patterns. Users of Amazon and eBay receive recommendations on products. Organizations such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and GooglePlus recommend users you may wish to connect with
    - Shape Recognition
        - Programs exist that allow crude hand-drawn diagrams and notes to be converted to more formal diagrams and text. This allows the shapes and lines of hand writing to be converted to more formal text which can then be searched and analyzed
    - Credit Card Fraud Detection
        - A profile is constructed about the purchasing patterns of a client. Any deviation from these patterns triggers an alert and the system automatically takes action. This action ranges from denying the transaction to notifying the authorities. Some of the events that are detected and could indicate a fraudulent transaction include purchasing products not normally purchased, purchases in a different geographic area, rapidly purchasing many different products, and purchasing large-ticket items
    - Facial Recognition
        - Security cameras are everywhere, from stores and streets to airports and transportation hubs. These cameras continually scan the crowds, normally watching for dangerous or illegal activities, but they can also be used to identify and track individuals. The system builds a pattern of specific facial features and then watches for a match to these facial patterns triggering some action
    - Anomaly Detection
        - In manufacturing, mining, transportation, and other areas, ML can be used to learn about normal operating conditions in mechanical systems. This makes it possible to detect unusual operating conditions that could signal that a something is ready to break. Over time, ML not only detect anomalies, but also suggest what the most likely cause of the anomaly may be. Anomaly detection is commonly used in preventive maintenance, but can also be used to detect other unusual conditions that could signal safety or security issues in other types of systems, such as data networks
    - Image Recognition
        - In image recognition, a system uses a set of known patterns to identify features of a digital image. Image recognition systems may recognize faces in photographs, help guide autonomous vehicles, or detect flaws in manufactured products. Actions may be performed based on the features that the system has recognized. It may guide the rejection of faulty products for quality assurance purposes or categorize photographs in personal photo collections. There are many uses for image recognition systems

## 4.2.3 Lab – Design a Prototype of an AI Application

- With IoT devices and IoT networks getting popular, technologies for IoT devices are also improving rapidly. IoT devices are no longer limited to sensors and actuators; they may have the capability to think and act accordingly according to environment changes, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
- In this lab, you will design a prototype for an AI application

## 4.3.1 What Is Intent-Based Networking (IBN)

- For a business to survive, it must be agile and respond quickly to the needs and demands of its customers. Businesses are increasingly dependent on their digital resources to meet customer demands, so the underlying IT network must also be responsive enough to quickly adapt to these requirements. This normally involves adjustments to many systems and processes. These adjustments may include changes to security policies and procedures, business services and applications, and operational policies
- With traditional networks, many different components must be manually adjusted to meet ever-changing business requirements. This requires different technicians and engineers to ensure that the systems are changed in a manner that allows them to work together to accomplish their goal. This sometimes results in errors and delays, and often in sub-optimal network performance
- The new business network must seamlessly and securely integrate IoT devices, cloud-based services, and remote offices in an agile, responsive, and business-relevant manner. Additionally, the network must secure these new digital initiatives from the ever-changing threat landscape
- To address this need, the IT industry has initiated an effort to create a systematic approach to tie infrastructure management to business intent. This approach is known as intent-based networking. The figure illustrates the general idea behind intent-based networking. With this new paradigm, business needs are automatically and continually translated into IT infrastructure execution

## 4.3.2 How are AI, ML, and IBN linked?

- Intent-based networking harnesses the power of automation, AI, and ML to control the function of a network to accomplish a specific purpose, or intent
- Intent-based networking allows the IT team to specify, in plain language, exactly what they want the network to accomplish and the network makes it happen. The network is able to translate the intent into policies and then use automation to deploy the appropriate configurations required across the network
- The intent-based network uses AI and ML to ensure that any services that are deployed meet the required service level. If they do not meet the service level, the intent-based network can make alerts and provide suggestions for improvement. In some cases, the intent-based network can automatically reconfigure the network to comply with the service levels

- The Intent-based Networking Model

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29455975/186631949-5ce8cffc-65b1-48d9-b780-7b2ef797754a.png)

- Assurance
    - The assurance element is end-to-end verification of network-wide behavior. It predicts the results of any changes, tracks compliance with the original intent, and makes recommendations or adjustments when there is a misalignment between the intent and the outcome. This stage relies heavily on AI and ML. Systems are part of a closed-loop that continually monitors performance and security of the network, and reconfigures the network to ensure compliance
- Translation
- The translation element is the ability to apply business intent to network configuration. The intent is what you wish to accomplish, not how it is accomplished. This intent is specified in plain language and used by the system to create policies across the system. For example, an intent might be to segment guest traffic from corporate traffic, or to enable access for remote users
- Activation
- The activation element occurs after the intent has been specified and the policies created. This is when individual devices are provisioned to match the intent-based policies. This can be an automated or semi-automated mode that allows the network team to verify configuration before the devices are deployed. An intent-based network creates an agile, responsive network that scales easily and adapts to meet business requirements. It makes efficient use of highly-skilled resources and allows man and machine to work together to optimize the customer experience. Additionally, intent-based networking provides a more secure digital experience by automating time consuming or complicated processes. This makes deploying security policies much easier

## 4.3.4 Lab – Research Intent-Based Networking (IBN)

- Today the network connects everything. What if the network could constantly adapt, protect, and notify based on the intent of the business owner? An intent-based network, on an open platform, can align the end-to-end network with that intent. It can bridge the gap between what the business needs and what the network delivers

## 4.3.6 Iota - reflection

- It’s fun to think of silly things to automate, like a toy for your cat. And sometimes those playful ideas lead to better ideas, and like the Intent-Based Network video said, better ideas can lead to great ideas! You can also think about big ideas for things to automate. Could automation help to clean up the planet? Could automation help to speed up medical research? Take a little time to think about ways that the IoT and automation could improve the world for everyone

## 4.4.1 Everything Can Be Automated Summary

- Automation
- This module began by discussing automation. Automation is any process that is self-driven and reduces, then eventually eliminates, the need for human intervention. The IoT opens up a new world in which tasks previously requiring human intervention can become automated. Many devices now incorporate smart technology to alter their behavior under certain circumstances. Some examples of smart technology can be found in smart homes and buildings, cities, a smart power grid, and smart cars
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
- Next, the module detailed Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the intelligence demonstrated by machines. As technology develops, many of the tasks that at one time required AI have become routine. Many of these tasks have migrated from AI to Machine Learning (ML). ML is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to “learn” from their environment. Some examples of ML in the IoT include speech and facial recognition, product recommendation, and credit card fraud detection
- Intent-Based Networking
- The next topic of this module covered Intent-Based Networking (IBN). The new business network must integrate IoT devices, cloud-based services, and remote offices in a way that is relevant and responsive to business. The network must secure these new digital initiatives from the ever-changing threat landscape. IBN is a systematic approach to tie infrastructure management to business intent
- An IBN uses AI and ML to ensure that any services that are deployed meet the required service level. A model of IBN contains three elements including assurance, translation, and activation. The Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA) is an example of an intent-based network.
